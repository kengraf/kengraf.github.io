              <h2>Canterbury Woods (NH)</h2>
              <strong>Thanks to the generosity of the Glines family, Gary played his last few rounds here while they were growing the grass.  I had my first hole-in-one here (#6).   As a member for 3 years, I only managed to play one round with a single golf ball.  You need to hit it straight, but birdie and eagle opportunities abound.</strong>

              <h2>Concord Country Club (NH)</h2>
              <strong>A beautiful track where all of the putts break to Suncook.  I won a few $K in cold hard cash, does that make me a professional?  A member for 10 years, my kids to learn how to play golf hitting tennis balls up and down the 1st and 18th fairways.</strong>

              <h2>Cochecho Country Club (NH)</h2>
              <strong>Amazing diverse and friendly membership, been a member for 15 years. The secret to good scores is being able to putt some very tricky greens. I had my 2nd hole-in-one on the 12th hole.  I really enjoy the winter hikes and snow showing.</strong>

              <h2>St. Andrews (Old Course)</h2>
              <strong>This was the final course for Karen and I on our Scotland trip.  It was great to play with all the history and could miss left all day.  A good birdie and wonderful drive over the hotel on the road hall where highlights.  Low light when someone picked up my ball on the 18th fairway while we're taking pictures on the bridge.  Great trip and ready to go back.</strong>

              <h2>Pebble Beach (CA)</h2>
              <strong>I've been lucky enough to play Pebble four times. The first time I managed to shoot a 78.  Great weather, easy setup, flyer lies, and a few good up and downs. The 7th hole pictured here is gorgeous, I almost jarred it playing with Jim, Angie, and Mom.</strong>

              <a class="thumbnail" href="/images/golf-pinehurst.jpg" data-position="left center"><img src="/images/golf-pinehurst.jpg" alt="" /></a>
              <h2>Pinehurst (NC)</h2>
              <strong>Played #2 with an experienced caddy (70 years) and it was surreal walking to the first tee and having the church bells go off as we prepared the tee off. A beautiful January day.  I would love to play the course again, you ready?</strong>

              <a class="thumbnail" href="/images/golf-princeville.jpg" data-position="left center"><img src="/images/golf-princeville.jpg" alt="" /></a>
              <h2>Princeville (Kauai, Hawaii)</h2>
              <strong>Fun trip with Mom and Dad to visit Jim and Angie.  Great course, introduced to Spam Musubi <a href="https://github.com/kengraf/recipes/blob/main/Apps-n-Game%20Food/Spam-Musubi.md">(recipe)</a>  The course was long/fun and with a great views of the Na Pali coast.  A must hike for anyone who visits Kauai.</strong>

              <a class="thumbnail" href="/images/golf-royal-dornoch.jpg" ><img src="/images/golf-royal-dornoch.jpg" alt="" /></a>
              <h2>Royal Dornoch (Scotland)</h2>
              <strong>My all-time favorite course, beautiful seaside, where Donald Ross learned to appreciate the game.  Elevation changes, rolling hills, and the need to use every club in the bag.  This is as close as I’ve seen to golf perfection.</strong>

              <a class="thumbnail" href="/images/golf-streamsong.jpg" data-position="left center"><img src="/images/golf-streamsong.jpg" alt="" /></a>
              <h2>Streamsong (Florida)</h2>
              <strong>Play both blue and red.  The fun caddy carried both days. He was Craig Stadler's caddy back in the day, former Alaska pipeline worker, and party boy.  On this hole did the classic dump the first shot in water, second rolled a foot past the hole.</strong>

              <a class="thumbnail" href="/images/golf-torry-pines.jpg" data-position="left center"><img src="/images/golf-torry-pines.jpg" alt="" /></a>
              <h2>Torrey Pines (San Diego)</h2>
              <strong>Played both the North and South. I found the North to be prettier and was smart enough to not play the tips on the South.  First time, just walked on with Mom after making good time driving down the Pacific Coast highway.  Second time, a get away trip with Beth. </strong>

              <a class="thumbnail" href="/images/golf-doral.jpg" data-position="left center"><img src="/images/golf-doral.jpg" alt="" /></a>
              <h2>Doral Country Club (Miami)</h2>
              <strong>Played this course as an oblivious teenager new to the game and without a clue of what is a good golf course.  But who passes up free golf even if it is the middle of summer in sunny Florida.</strong>

              <a class="thumbnail" href="/images/golf-crumpin-fox.jpg" data-position="left center"><img src="/images/golf-crumpin-fox.jpg" alt="" /></a>
              <h2>Crumpin Fox (MA)</h2>
              <strong>Is it possible that every hole can play downhill?  Fairways are wide and the greens generous but sectioned.  Good scores require the right section. First golfing weekend with Beth.</strong>

              <a class="thumbnail" href="/images/golf-harbour-town.jpg" data-position="left center"><img src="/images/golf-harbour-town.jpg" alt="" /></a>
              <h2>Harbour Town (Hilton Head)</h2>
              <strong>A beautiful January day, sunny, upper 50s, and froze out all the locals. No foursome, no caddies, I literally had the course to myself.  By far the narrowest course I've ever played with trouble everywhere. Despite what the locals think it was a great day for golf.</strong>

              <h2>Highlands Links (Nova Scotia)</h2>
              <strong>Right after 9/11, I was offered a promotion to be the company's hatchet man.  I said no and took a long drive to Cape Breton for the all-time best golf deal. Play Canada’s best course, cart, range, dinner, and room at the Keltic Lodge for $69 Canadian.  FYI: I got axed in Maine on the drive home.</strong>
